                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Men's Mentorship exists to guide and empower men in their journey toward becoming godly leaders, 
                    faithful husbands, loving fathers, and men of unwavering character. Through biblical teachings, 
                    practical wisdom, and a supportive community, we help men discover their purpose and live it out 
                    with excellence and integrity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that every man has the potential to make a significant impact in his family, workplace, 
                    and community. Our mission is to provide the tools, resources, and encouragement needed to unlock 
                    that potential and live a life that honors God and serves others.

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-bible"></i> Biblical Foundation</h3>
                    <p>
                        All our teachings are rooted in Scripture. We believe the Bible provides timeless wisdom 
                        and practical guidance for every area of life.
                    </p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Integrity</h3>
                    <p>
                        We champion authenticity and honesty. True manhood is built on a foundation of character 
                        that remains consistent in public and private.
                    </p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-hands-helping"></i> Community</h3>
                    <p>
                        No man is an island. We foster a brotherhood where men can be vulnerable, accountable, 
                        and supportive of one another's growth.

                    <p>
                        We encourage men to pursue excellence in all they doâ€”not perfection, but a commitment 
                        to continuous growth and improvement.

                    <p>
                        True leadership means serving others. We teach men to lead with humility, compassion, 
                        and a heart to make others better.

                    <p>
                        Faith without works is dead. We encourage men to put their beliefs into practice through 
                        daily decisions and actions.
